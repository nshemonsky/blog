    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So after starting this blog at the beginning of the year it fell to the back
burner in the last several months as lots of things have changed in my life.</p>

<p>I started a new position just over a month ago where I will now get to focus on
supporting cloud technologies, infrastructure as code and evangelizing devops
methodologies. Exciting stuff and so far I&rsquo;m loving it.</p>

<p>I also finally got around to finishing my MCSA on Windows Server 2008. Glad I
got it done when I did because as I get up to speed in the new role, I certainly
wouldn&rsquo;t have had time to do it.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m getting back in the groove, I intend to start posting somewhat
regularly and hope to put some stuff up regarding working with Chef shortly.</p>
